# Python Keylogger

-  This won't work if you haven't installed Python on your computer.
-  And install pynput with the following command:``` pip3 install pynput```
-  If you're using MacOS type this into you Terminal 
-  If Windows type it to your command promt.
-  Run the keylogger.py file in the cmd or terminal, run it with ```python keylogger.py```     # Be sure to be in the current directory before executing this command
-  If you don't know the basic commands of cmd: ```dir``` to list (very similar to `ls`) and `cd` to change dir (exactly like linux kernal)
-  If it didn't work try ```python3``` instead of ```python```
-  Happy Getting Keylogged!
